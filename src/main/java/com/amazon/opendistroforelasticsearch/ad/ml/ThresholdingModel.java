 * A model for converting raw anomaly scores into anomaly grades.

 * anomaly scores is that the larger the score the more anomalous the
 * corresponding data point. Based on this training set an internal threshold is
 * computed to determine if a given score is anomalous. The thresholding model
 * can be updated with new anomaly scores such as in a streaming context.
